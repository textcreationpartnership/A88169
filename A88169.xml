            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE REMONSTRANCE OF Lieutenant Colonel John Lilburn, to the Freeborn people of England; and His Declaration and Speech to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on Tueſday laſt, in anſwer to the Sentence denounced againſt him at the Bar.</head>
            <p>ON Tueſday laſt (being the 20 of this inſtant January) Lieut. Col. John Lilburn was brought before the Parliament (being attended by the Serjeant at Arms) and being come to the Bar, Mr. Speaker (in the Name of the whole Houſe) made a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117350:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 38 -->and excellent Oration to him, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he minded him of the Parliaments former favour and clemency, and of their gracious and free remittance of his by-paſt errours &amp; tranſgreſſions; but now falling into a further Relapſe, whoſe fact and crime, were of ſo ſad and dangerous conſequence, that it extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a high breach of the priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; in order whereunto Mr. Speaker declared, that he was commanded by the Parliament to denounce the Judgment of the Houſe againſt him; whicd was, That he ſhould pay the fine of 7000 <abbr>l.</abbr> &amp; be baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of England, Scotland, and Ireland, &amp; the Dominions thereof, within the ſpace of 30 days; and in caſe he ſhal ever return, or be found in any of the aforeſaid Dominions, then to be try'd as a Felon, and to ſuffer the pangs of death.</p>
            <p>A dreadful ſentence, reply'd Mr. Lilburn, but not in the leaſt terrifying to a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117350:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 38 -->And Mr. Speaker, give me leave, I beſeech you, and the reſt of the members here preſent; to declare, That as bondage and liberty are two contraries, ſo you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſider the one, but you muſt reflect your eyes upon the other: For though one be ſo deſtructive to the being of the other, that where the one is, the other cannot be; yet, each by other is more eminently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed: and look how the one is exceeding the other, by ſo much the other is deficient, and loſeth of its property; and therefore if you will caſt your eyes upon the glory and beauty of the one, your ears muſt be open to the cries and complaints of the other. As for my part, I am reſolved, that as in heart I defie all injuſtice, cruelty, tyranny, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, all arbytrary Uſurpation and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers whatſoever, ſo in perſon (come life, come death) I will not be ſo treacherous to my ſelf, to my wife and children, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

               <!-- PDF PAGE 39 -->to this Nation (the Land of my Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity) in general, as perſonally to yield my active ſubmiſſion for exilement. But being remanded from the Bar, a period was put to his allegations; and a place of Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment provided, under the power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Serjeant at Arms.</p>

And therefore, ſaith the ſpirit of God, in all their afflictions, he was afflicted, and the Angel of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſaved him, Eſay 63.9. Paul, Peter, and John, found theſe ſayings of their Maſter true, and had their portions in afflictions in an extraordinaay man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but yet taſted largely of the faithfulneſſe of their Maſters promiſe, which was to be with them, and in them; which made Paul glory in his tribulations, and to ſay, That as his afflictions did abound, ſo much more his conſolations; and Paul's portion in theſe expreſſions and enjoyments, I my ſelf have been made partaker of, in my great and preſſing tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I under-went in the Biſhops dayes, and have had a large portion of ſorrowes all along both before and ſince, throughout my pilgrimage in this preſent Vail of teares.

A good Conſcience had rather run the hazard of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, then to abate an hairs breadth of conteſtation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt illegality. This was the ſaying of Mr. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in his late Caſe, depending in the Houſe of Peers; for, ſaith he, <q>As their Lordſhips in their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytrary capacity found Warrants; ſo ſhould they find Legs to obey them; for I was reſolved mine ſhould not be inſlaved to that their Uſurpation to do their Arbytrary Drudgery; I would rather loſe my life, then in that kind to do them that vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalage: My Legs were born as free as the reſt of my Body, and therefore I ſcorn that Legs, or arms, or hands, ſhould do them any ſervicer; for as I am a free-man by Birth, ſo am I reſolved to live and die, both in heart, word and deed, in ſubſtance and in ſhew.</q>
